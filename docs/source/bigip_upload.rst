upload
======

Code
----

.. automethod:: bigrest.bigip.BIGIP.upload

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    device.upload(
        "/mgmt/cm/autodeploy/software-image-uploads", "bigrest.iso")

Explanation
-----------

| This upload the local file to the device.
| The API limit uploads to chunks of 1M, so BIGREST will handle that.
| You just need to pass the HTTP path to the location to upload and the local file.

| I am only aware of 2 locations that you can upload files to BIG-IP.


| **Folder:** /var/config/rest/downloads
| **HTTP path:** /mgmt/shared/file-transfer/uploads

| **Folder:** /shared/images
| **HTTP path:** /mgmt/cm/autodeploy/software-image-downloads

| **/var/config/rest/downloads** is the folder created for iControl REST API downloads and uploads.
| While **/shared/images** is where we have software images.
